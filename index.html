									The AwesomeBot project has been discontinued. Official active development of current and future versions, including the previously upcoming Neo release, has been ceased. In addition, all AwesomeBot-related pages and services have been deleted, including, but not limited to:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>website and config interface</li>
									<li>bot account @AwesomeBot#8353</li>
									<li>official Discord server</li>
									<li>wiki and other documentation</li>
									<li>Twitter account @awesomebotxyz</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We did not take this decision lightly, but it was necessary due to personal commitments of my own and the rest of the developer team. However, we deeply appreciate the ongoing support of the AwesomeBot community throughout the tenure of the project. Your contributions, feedback, and participation was highly valued and allowed us to maintain the bot for nearly 14 months. With your enthusiasm, we were able to reach more than 10,000 servers across Discord, totaling hundreds of thousands of users.
								</p>
								<p>
									To that end, development of AwesomeBot may continue in an unofficial capacity. The work-in-progress source code for version 4 of the bot is available <a href="https://github.com/BitQuote/AwesomeBot/">on GitHub</a>, freely provided for you to test, host, and build upon. Also, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/fGsCj8J">AwesomeBot community server</a> to discuss self-hosting and future development with other members of the community.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thank you.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sincerely,<br>
									BitQuote
